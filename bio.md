I am an Assistant Professor in Electrical & Computer Engineering at UW Seattle.

I am co-director of the [BioRobotics Lab](http://brl.ee.washington.edu) and [AMP Center](http://depts.washington.edu/amplify).

I am affiliated with the [WRF](http://www.wrfseattle.org/)-funded [UW Institute for Neuroengineering (UWIN)](http://uwin.uw.edu) and the [AFOSR](http://www.wpafb.af.mil/afrl/afosr)-funded Center of Excellence on [Nature-Inspired Flight Technologies and Ideas (NIFTI)](http://nifti.washington.edu).

I am broadly interested in discovering and formalizing principles of sensorimotor control; I develop and employ data-driven methods and focus on applications in biologically-inspired robotics, neuromechanical motor control, and human-cyber-physical systems.

I've taught the following courses:
* [EE 447](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1219938) (Control System Analysis) in Fall 2018, Fall 2019
* [AA/EE/ME 546](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1352564) (Optimization and Learning for Control) in Spring 2018
* [AA/EE/ME 546](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1153606) (Hybrid Systems:  Theory, Computation, and Applications) in Spring 2017
* [AA/EE/ME 547](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/986611/) (Linear Systems Theory) in Fall 2015, Fall 2016
* [AA/EE/ME 548](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1371041) (Linear Multivariable Control) in Winter 2016, Winter 2017, Winter 2019, Spring 2020
* [AA/EE/ME 594](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1311510) (Robust Control) in Spring 2019

I keep my availability up-to-date on my [calendar]({{ site.url }}/calendar) &mdash; I'm usually available in any open slot 8a&ndash;5p pt M&ndash;F.

I welcome [suggestions]({{ site.url }}/suggest) for updates to my website.

I try to keep my [CV]({{ site.url }}/cv.pdf) up-to-date, but I suggest checking [papers]({{ site.url }}/papers) and [talks]({{ site.url }}/talks) for recent results.

I'm on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Burden_S/0/1/0/all/0/1), [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I9KPV_MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [GitHub](https://github.com/sburden), and [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/sam-burden).

I was born in a (formerly) [little-known town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forks,_Washington) on the (stunning) [Olympic Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Peninsula).  

I enjoy [climbing](http://www.seattleboulderingproject.com/), [paddleboarding](http://collegeclubseattle.com/), and [hiking](http://www.everytrail.com/best/hiking-seattle-washington). 

[My pronouns](https://www.mypronouns.org/) are he/him/his.

## brief bio

Sam Burden earned his BS with Honors in Electrical Engineering from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2008.  He earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from the University of California in Berkeley in 2014, where he subsequently spent one year as a Postdoctoral Scholar.  In 2015, he returned to UW EE (now ECE) as an Assistant Professor; in 2016, he received a Young Investigator award from the Army Research Office (ARO-YIP).  Sam is broadly interested in discovering and formalizing principles of sensorimotor control.  Specifically, he focuses on applications in dynamic and dexterous robotics, neuromechanical motor control, and human-cyber-physical systems.  In his spare time, he teaches robotics to students of all ages in classrooms and campus events.

## research program

I am always eager to recruit motivated and independent folks.  If you're interested in joining my group, I encourage you to get in contact with me.  Ideally we'll meet in person, e.g. at a conference, but we can also connect over email.  

Before reaching out, look at my recent [papers]({{ site.url }}/papers), [talks]({{ site.url }}/talks), and videos below, and let me know (a) what ideas or problems you find particularly interesting and (b) how you would want to contribute.

### [Toward Telelocomotion:  human sensorimotor control of contact-rich robot dynamics]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20200117-cmu-ri.pptx)

I talked in the CMU Robotics Institute Seminar on Jan 17, 2020.

### Why (or, more specifically, when) do feedforward inputs yield stable behaviors? ([slides]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20180522-dw.pptx)) ([chalk talk]({{ site.url }}/_talks/20180522-dw-chalk-talk.pdf)) 

At the 2018 Dynamic Walking meeting in Pensacola, FL, I gave a hybrid slideshow / "chalk talk" on our contraction theory results, which generated a lot of interesting discussions.
